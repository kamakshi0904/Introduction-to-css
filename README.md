# Introduction-to-css

CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style and design web pages by controlling how HTML elements look on the screen. While HTML provides the structure and content, CSS defines the presentationâ€”things like colors, fonts, spacing, layouts, backgrounds, and even animations. The big advantage of CSS is that it separates content from design, which makes websites easier to maintain and more consistent; for example, you can change the theme color of an entire site by editing just one CSS file. CSS can be applied in three main ways: inline (inside the HTML tag itself), internal (inside a `<style>` block within the HTML document), or external (through a separate `.css` file linked to the HTML, which is considered best practice). Its syntax works by selecting an element and applying properties with specific values, such as `p { color: red; font-size: 18px; }` which makes all paragraphs red and 18 pixels in size. With CSS, developers can design responsive, flexible, and visually appealing websites that adapt to different screen sizes and devices, making it a core technology alongside HTML and JavaScript in web development.
